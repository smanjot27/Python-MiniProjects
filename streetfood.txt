Street food consists of ready-to-eat foods or drinks sold by a hawker, or vendor, in a street or other public place, such as at a market or fair. It is often sold from a portable food booth,[1] food cart, or food truck and meant for immediate consumption. Some street foods are regional, but many have spread beyond their region of origin. Most street foods are classified as both finger food and fast food, and are typically cheaper than restaurant meals. The types of street food varies among regions and cultures in different countries around the world.[2] According to a 2007 study from the Food and Agriculture Organization, 2.5 billion people eat street food every day.[3] A majority of middle-income consumers[4] rely on the quick access and cheap service of street food for daily nutrition and job opportunities, especially in developing countries.File:Churro-Vendor.ogvPlay mediaA video clip of a vendor making churros in ColombiaToday, people may purchase street food for a number of reasons, such as convenience, to get flavourful food for a reasonable price in a sociable setting, prompt service, to try ethnic cuisines, or for nostalgia.[5]Rising concerns of street food includes health hazards and sanitation issues, illegal usage of public or private areas, social and ethical problems, and traffic congestion.
